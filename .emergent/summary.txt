<analysis>original_problem_statement:
The user wants to create a full, editable copy of an existing project from a GitHub repository.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
-   **Source Project:** 
-   **Cloning Rule:** The duplicated project must be 100% identical to the original. No redesigning, re-structuring, or changing UI, layout, components, colors, frameworks, or libraries.
-   **API Token:** An API token () for a football API must be used. It should be passed in an HTTP header named  and configured via environment variables, not hardcoded.
-   **Database:** Use the existing schema/structure. No data migration is needed.
-   **Workflow:** All future changes are to be made only *after* the user confirms the clone has been successfully completed and is running correctly.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The source GitHub repository has been successfully cloned into the  directory. The agent has read the contents of all the files within the cloned repository to understand its structure. The root  directory still contains the default project template files which need to be replaced.

**Last working item**:
    - Last item agent was working: The agent was about to copy the entire project source code from the temporary clone directory () into the main working directory () and then proceed with installing the necessary dependencies.
    - Status: IN PROGRESS
    - Agent Testing Done: N
    - Which testing method agent to use? manual testing by curl
    - User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
  - Issue 1: The application is not yet running because the setup is incomplete. (Priority: P0)

  Issues Detail:
  - Issue 1:
     - Attempted fixes: None. This is part of the initial setup process.
     - Next debug checklist:
        1.  Copy the project files from  to , overwriting the existing template files.
        2.  Inspect the backend code (especially ) to determine the correct environment variable name for the football API token.
        3.  Create a  file in the  directory and add the API token:  (or whatever variable name the code expects).
        4.  Install backend dependencies using .
        5.  Install frontend dependencies (if any, although it appears to be a vanilla JS project, so there may not be a ).
        6.  Examine  to see how to run the server (it's likely Flask or a similar framework).
        7.  Start the backend service using backend                          RUNNING   pid 46, uptime 0:00:11

supervisor> .
        8.  Confirm the application is running by accessing the frontend and making an API call that uses the token.
     - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix? This will complete the initial user request of setting up an identical, working clone of the source project.
     - Status:  IN PROGRESS
     - Is recurring issue? N
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? Both
     - Blocked on other issue: None

**In progress Task List**:
- Task 1: Complete Project Cloning and Setup (Priority: P0)
  - Where to resume: The agent needs to execute the shell command to copy the files from  to . After that, it must handle dependency installation and environment variable configuration.
  - What will be achieved with this? A fully functional, editable clone of the user's project will be running in the environment.
  - Status: IN PROGRESS
  - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? Both
  - Blocked on something: None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- All future development tasks are on hold until the user provides confirmation that the project clone is complete and working as expected.

**Completed work in this session**
- Cloned the source repository  into .
- Read the entire file structure and content of the cloned repository.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- None.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- None.

**Code Architecture**
The project is not a React/FastAPI application. Based on the file analysis, the architecture is:
-   **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main files are , , and  in the root directory.
-   **Backend**: Python. The code is located in the  directory, with the main application logic in  and dependencies in . The framework is likely Flask.


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla)
-   Backend: Python (likely Flask)
-   API Integration: Consumes an external football data API.

**key DB schema**
-   No database is used in this project. It appears to be a stateless application that relies on an external API for data.

**changes in tech stack**
-   None. The stack is being preserved from the original repository.

**All files of reference**
-   : Main backend application file.
-   : Backend Python dependencies.
-   : Main frontend entry point.
-   : Frontend JavaScript logic.
-   : Frontend styles.

These files exist in the temporary  directory and need to be copied to .

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   None. The user explicitly requested no refactoring or changes.

**key api endpoints**
-   The backend exposes endpoints that the frontend consumes. The specifics are within , but they have not been started or tested yet.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **IGNORE THE DEFAULT STACK:** The project is **NOT** a React/FastAPI application. It is a vanilla HTML/JS/CSS frontend with a Python (likely Flask) backend. Do not apply any logic or use tools related to React.
-   **API TOKEN:** The API token  must be configured as an environment variable for the backend. You need to inspect  to find the expected variable name and place it in a  file within the  directory.
-   **USER CONFIRMATION:** Do not proceed with any changes or new tasks until you have set up the project and received explicit confirmation from the user that it is working correctly.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
- None.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
1.  **User:** Confirmed that the API token is for a football API, should be used in the  header, and stored in an env var. (Completed: Agent acknowledged)
2.  **User:** Explicitly stated not to adapt the project to a different stack (e.g., React/Python/FastAPI). (Completed: Agent acknowledged)
3.  **User:** Stated to use the existing schema and that no data migration is needed. (Completed: Agent acknowledged)
4.  **User:** Instructed that future changes will only come after the clone is complete and confirmed. (Completed: Agent acknowledged)
5.  **User:** Requested confirmation once the cloning and setup are 100% complete and running. (Pending: Agent has not finished setup)
6.  **User:** Start the task now (Completed: Agent started)

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Broken:** The application is not yet deployed or running. The files are cloned but not installed, configured, or served.
-   **Mocked:** No components are mocked.

**3rd Party Integrations**
-   **Football Data API:** A third-party API for football match data, authenticated via the  header. The endpoint is likely specified within the project's source code.

**Testing status**
  - Testing agent used after significant changes: NO
  - Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop: NO
  - Test files created: []
  - Known regressions: []

**Credentials to test flow:**
-   **API Token:**  (to be used in  header)

**What agent forgot to execute**
- The agent has not yet created a plan to handle the user-provided API token. It acknowledged the token but did not incorporate setting it as an environment variable into its plan before starting the file operations.</analysis>
